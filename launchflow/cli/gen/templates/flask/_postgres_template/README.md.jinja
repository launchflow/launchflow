## ⚙️ Install LaunchFlow

This application is automated with [LaunchFlow](https://docs.launchflow.com/). <br/> Make sure you have it installed before running the commands below.


```bash
# Install LaunchFlow with pip
pip install launchflow[{{ cloud_provider }}]

# NOTE: If you are using zsh, you may need to escape the square brackets
pip install launchflow\[{{ cloud_provider }}\]
```

If this is your first time using LaunchFlow, you will need to connect your cloud provider account.

```bash
# This will open a browser window to authenticate with {{ cloud_provider.upper() }}
launchflow connect --provider {{ cloud_provider }}
```

## ⚒️ Create your Infrastructure

Automatically <strong>find</strong> and <strong>create</strong> all infrastructure used by your application.

```bash
launchflow create
```

Learn how this command works in the [LaunchFlow Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/reference/cli#lf-create).

## 🏃 Run your Application (local)

Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Flask application locally using [Flask's Development Server](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/server/).

```bash
flask --app app.main run --reload
```

#### NOTE: The Flask Development Server is not suitable for production.
#### The `Dockerfile` and `launchflow deploy` command uses [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) instead.

## 🚀 Deploy your Application (remote)

Automatically <strong>build</strong> and <strong>deploy</strong> the Flask application to your cloud.

```bash
launchflow deploy
```

Learn how this command works in the [LaunchFlow Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/reference/cli#lf-deploy).

## 🧹 Clean up your infrastructure

Automatically <strong>delete</strong> all infrastructure <strong>NOT</strong> currently used in your application code.

This is useful for finding and removing old resources that are no longer needed.

```bash
launchflow clean
```

Learn how this command works in the [LaunchFlow Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/reference/cli#lf-clean).

## 💥 Destroy your infrastructure

Automatically <strong>delete</strong> all infrastructure associated with your application.

```bash
launchflow destroy
```

Learn how this command works in the [LaunchFlow Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/reference/cli#lf-destroy).
