This application is automated with [LaunchFlow](https://docs.launchflow.com/). <br/> Make sure you have it installed before running the commands below.


```bash
# Install LaunchFlow with pip
pip install launchflow[{{ cloud_provider }}]

pip install launchflow\[{{ cloud_provider }}\]
```

If this is your first time using LaunchFlow, you will need to connect your cloud provider account.

```bash
# This will open a browser window to authenticate with {{ cloud_provider.upper() }}
launchflow connect --provider {{ cloud_provider }}
```
