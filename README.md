[LaunchFlow](https://launchflow.com/) is an open source deployment tool that makes it easy to launch applications to Serverless, VMs, & Kubernetes on AWS and GCP.

Use the Python SDK to define your infrastructure in code, then run `lf deploy` to deploy everything to a dedicated environment in your cloud account.

Fully customizable but configured by default - no messy YAML required.

## üß† Concepts

### Deployments - [Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/docs/concepts/deployments)

Deployments allow you to deploy websites, APIs, background workers and other types of applications to your cloud account with minimal setup. There are 3 deployment types: **Services**, **Workers**, and **Jobs**.

> [!NOTE]
> LaunchFlow is not just for deploying Python apps. The Python SDK is used to define your infrastructure in code, but you can deploy any application that runs on a VM, container, or serverless environment.
>
> <b>Python is just the language for your DevOps automation.</b>

### Resources - [Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/docs/concepts/resources)

Resources are the cloud services that your application uses, such as databases, storage, queues, and secrets. LaunchFlow provides a simple way to define, manage, and use these resources in your application.

### Environments - [Docs](https://docs.launchflow.com/docs/concepts/environments)

Environments group **Deployments** and **Resources** inside a private network (VPC) on either GCP or AWS. You can create multiple environments for different stages of your workflow (e.g. development, staging, production) and switch between them with a single command.

</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
pip install launchflow
```

## üöÄ Quickstart

### Step 1. Create a new Python file (e.g. `main.py`) and add the following code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def index():
    return f'Hello from {lf.environment}!'
```

### Step 2. Add a Deployment type to your Python file:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import launchflow as lf

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def index():
    return f'Hello from {lf.environment}!'

# Deploy this FastAPI app to ECS Fargate on AWS
api = lf.aws.ECSFargate("my-api", domain_name="launchflow.com")
```

### Step 3. Run the `lf deploy` command to deploy your infrastructure:

```bash
lf deploy
```

### This command will do the following:
1. Generate a Dockerfile and launchflow.yaml file <font size="-1">(if you don't have one)</font>
2. Create a new VPC (Environment) in your AWS account <font size="-1">(if you don't have one)</font>
3. Create a new ECS Fargate service and task definition <font size="-1">(if you don't have one)</font>
4. Create a new Application Load Balancer and Route 53 DNS record <font size="-1">(if you don't have one)</font>
5. Build a Docker image and push it to ECR
6. Deploy your FastAPI app to the new ECS Fargate service
7. Output the URL & DNS settings of your new FastAPI app

### Step 4. Add a Resource type to your Python file:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import launchflow as lf

# Resource permissions are automatically configured for you
bucket = lf.gcp.S3Bucket("my-bucket")

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def index():
    bucket.upload_from_string(f"Hello from {lf.environment}!", "hello.txt")
    return bucket.download_file("hello.txt").decode()

# Deploy this FastAPI app to ECS Fargate on AWS
api = lf.aws.ECSFargate("my-api", domain_name="launchflow.com")
```

### Step 5. Run the `lf deploy` command to deploy your updated infrastructure:

```bash
lf deploy
```
