LaunchFlow is an open source Python SDK that lets you deploy websites, APIs, and other applications to AWS / GCP with minimal configuration. See the [welcome page](/) for an overview.

Eventhough LaunchFlow is written and used in Python it can be used to deploy nearly any application to any runtime on AWS and GCP.
