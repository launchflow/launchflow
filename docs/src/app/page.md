LaunchFlow enables you to manage your application's infrastructure, secrets, and deployments from Python code. It runs entirely on your local machine and everything is created in your own cloud account. Follow the [Get Started Guide](/docs/get-started) to start launching infrastructure on GCP, AWS, and Docker in a matter of minutes.

## Core Concepts

[Resources](https://docs.launchflow.com/docs/concepts/resources) allow you to add things like databases, storage, and networking to your application by simply importing them in your code.

[Services](https://docs.launchflow.com/docs/concepts/services) make it easy to setup Docker registries, load balancers, service containers, and other configuration required to deploy and release your application.

[Environments](https://docs.launchflow.com/docs/concepts/environments) manage the permissions, configuration, and lifecycle of your cloud resources and services.

LaunchFlow is framework agnostic and can run wherever Python runs. It also integrates with popular frameworks, allowing you get started faster. See our framework guides for specific examples of how to integrate LaunchFlow into your existing codebase:

- [FastAPI](/docs/framework-guides/fastapi)
- [Flask](/docs/framework-guides/flask)
- [Django](/docs/framework-guides/django)
